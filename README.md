# Find my Watch

Can detect when the Garmin Instinct (My Watch) is with the frame of the camerea. 
## The Algorithm

My program uses pythorch's Resnet18 model to classy a binary paramater, is the watch in the frame or not. Comparing images that do and do not have the watch in the frame analasye the common atrributes and learning if my watch is or isn't in frame. I used the base of the Jeston Nano Thumps project, so setting up the Jupiter Doccer is required. 

## Running this project

1. Downaload My files in a zip folder
2. Go to your jeston Nano and open your docker with ./docker_dli_run.sh 
3. upoload the find_watch_ai file into your Jupytar Notebook
4. Go into Find_watch_Final and run the file
